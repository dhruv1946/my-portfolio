## üìò Getting Started

git clone https://github.com/dhruv1946/my-portfolio

2) Navigate to the project directory:

üìÇMy Portfolio :

3) Open the index.html file in your favorite web browser.

## üîß Customize for yourself
This portfolio is designed to be easily customized.

1) Update Personal Information
Open `index.html` and modify the text content directly within the HTML elements. You can change:

- Your name, title, and description in the `#about` section.

- Your education and experience details in the `#timeline` sections.

- Your email, phone number, and social media links in the `#contact` section.

- The path to your resume file in the "Download Resume" button's `href` attribute.

2) Update Skills and Projects
Open `script.js` to modify the skills and projects that are displayed on the site.

- To add or change skills, edit the `skillsData` array in the `script.js` file. The level property controls the final width of the skill bar.

`const skillsData = [`

 `   { name: 'HTML', level: '95%' },`

`    { name: 'CSS', level: '75%' },`

`   // Add or modify your skills here`

`];`

- To add or change projects, edit the `projectsData` array. Update the `title,` `description`, `liveUrl`, and `githubUrl` for each project.

`const projectsData = [`
 
`    {` 

`        title: "Your Project Title",` 

`        description: "A brief description of your project.",` 

`        liveUrl: "#", // Link to the live demo`

`        githubUrl: "#" // Link to the GitHub repository`

`    },`

`    // Add or modify your projects here`

`];`

3) Change Images
Replace the image files in the project folder with your own. You will need to update the file paths in:

- `index.html` for the main profile picture `(<img class="profile-image">)`.

- `style.css` for the background image in the about section `(.about-section::before)`.

4) Customize Theme Colors
All theme colors are defined as CSS variables at the top of the `style.css` file. You can easily change the entire site's color scheme by modifying these variables for both light and dark modes.

`:root {`

`    --cyan: #22d3ee;`

`    --blue: #0ea5e9;`

`    --bg-color-light: #f9fafb;`

`    /* ... other light theme colors */`

`    --bg-color-dark: #0a0a0a;`

 `   /* ... other dark theme colors */`

`}`
